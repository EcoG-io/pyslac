# [V2G3-M06-05]- In case NO communication could be established with a
# 5 % control pilot duty cycle (matching process not started), if the EVSE
# wants to switch to a nominal duty cycle, then the change from 5 % to a
# nominal duty cycle shall be done with a specific sequence
# B2 or C2 (5 %) -> E or F -> B2 (nominal value) to allow backward
# compatibility. The minimum time at the control pilot state E or F is
# defined by T_step_EF.

# [V2G3-M06-06] In case a communication has already been established within
# 5 % control pilot duty cycle (“Matched state” reached or
# matching process ongoing), a change from 5 % to a nominal duty cycle shall be
# done with a X1 state in the middle (minimum time as defined in [IEC-3]
# Seq 9.2), to signal the EV that the control pilot duty cycle will change to a
# nominal duty cycle

# [V2G3 M06-07] - If an AC EVSE applies a 5 % control pilot duty cycle,
# and the EVSE receives NO SLAC request within TT_EVSE_SLAC_init, the EVSE
# shall go to state E or F for T_step_EF (min 4 s), shall go back to 5 % duty
# cycle, and  shall reset the TT_EVSE_SLAC_init timeout before being ready to
# answer a matching request again. This sequence shall be retried
# C_sequ_retry times (2). At the end, without any reaction, the EVSE shall go
# to state X1

# [V2G3-M06-08] After positive EIM, if no matching process is running, the EVSE
# shall signal control pilot state E/F for T_step_EF, then signal control pilot
# state X1/X2 (nominal).

# [V2G3 -M06-09] If a control pilot state E/F -> Bx, Cx, Dx transition is used
# for triggering retries or legacy issues, the state E/F shall be at least
# T_step_EF.

# [V2G2-852] - If no positive authorization information from an EIM has been
# received the EVSE shall apply PWM equal to 5 %.

# [V2G2-853] - If an EVSE receives positive authorization information from an
# EIM the EVSE shall apply a nominal duty cycle.

# [V2G2-931] - The EVSE shall signal a PWM of 5 % or nominal duty cycle after
# sending the message AuthorizationRes.
